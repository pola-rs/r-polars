\description{
lifecycle:: Deprecate
Restruct an object where structs where previously unnested
}
\details{
It was much easier impl export unnested struct from polars. This function
restructs exported unnested structs.
This function should be repalced with rust code writing this output
directly before nesting.
This hack relies on rust uses the tag "is_struct" to mark what should be re-structed.

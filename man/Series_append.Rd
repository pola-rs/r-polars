\alias{Series_append}
\title{append (default immutable)}
\usage{
Series_append(other, immutable = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{other}{Series to append}

\item{immutable}{bool should append be immutable, default TRUE as mutable operations should
be avoided in plain R API's.}
}
\value{
Series
}
\description{
append two Series, see details for mutability
}
\details{
if immutable = FLASE, the Series object will not behave as immutable. This mean
appending to this Series will affect any variable pointing to this memory location. This will break
normal scoping rules of R. Polars-clones are cheap. Mutable operations are likely never needed in
any sense.

\examples{

#default immutable behaviour, s_imut and s_imut_copy stay the same
s_imut = pl$Series(1:3)
s_imut_copy = s_imut
s_new = s_imut$append(pl$Series(1:3))
identical(s_imut$to_r_vector(),s_imut_copy$to_r_vector())

#pypolars-like mutable behaviour,s_mut_copy become the same as s_new
s_mut = pl$Series(1:3)
s_mut_copy = s_mut
 #must deactivate this to allow to use immutable=FALSE
pl$set_polars_options(strictly_immutable = FALSE)
s_new = s_mut$append(pl$Series(1:3),immutable= FALSE)
identical(s_new$to_r_vector(),s_mut_copy$to_r_vector())

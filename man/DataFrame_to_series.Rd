\title{Get column by index}
\usage{
DataFrame_to_series(idx = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{Index of the column to return as Series. Defaults to 0, which is
the first column.}
}
\value{
Series or NULL
}
\description{
Extract a DataFrame column (by index) as a Polars series. Unlike
\code{get_column()}, this method will not fail but will return a \code{NULL} if the
index doesn't exist in the DataFrame. Keep in mind that Polars is 0-indexed
so "0" is the first column.
}
\examples{
df = pl$DataFrame(iris[1:10, ])

# default is to extract the first column
df$to_series()

# Polars is 0-indexed, so we use idx = 1 to extract the *2nd* column
df$to_series(idx = 1)

# doesn't error if the column isn't there
df$to_series(idx = 8)
}

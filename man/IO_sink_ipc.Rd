\usage{
LazyFrame_sink_ipc(
  path,
  compression = "zstd",
  maintain_order = TRUE,
  type_coercion = TRUE,
  predicate_pushdown = TRUE,
  projection_pushdown = TRUE,
  simplify_expression = TRUE,
  slice_pushdown = TRUE,
  no_optimization = FALSE,
  inherit_optimization = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{String. The path to the Arrow IPC file}

\item{compression}{\code{NULL} or string, the compression method. One of \code{NULL},
"lz4" or "zstd". Choose "zstd" for good compression performance. Choose "lz4"
for fast compression/decompression.}

\item{maintain_order}{Keep the same order as the original \code{LazyFrame}. Setting
this to \code{TRUE} makes it more expensive to compute and blocks the possibility
to run on the streaming engine. The default value can be changed with
\code{pl$set_options(maintain_order = TRUE)}.}

\item{type_coercion}{Boolean. Coerce types such that operations succeed and
run on minimal required memory.}

\item{predicate_pushdown}{Boolean. Applies filters as early as possible at
scan level.}

\item{projection_pushdown}{Boolean. Select only the columns that are needed
at the scan level.}

\item{simplify_expression}{Boolean. Various optimizations, such as constant
folding and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives.}

\item{slice_pushdown}{Boolean. Only load the required slice from the scan
level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (e.g. \code{join$head(10)}).}

\item{no_optimization}{Boolean. Sets the following parameters to \code{FALSE}:
\code{predicate_pushdown}, \code{projection_pushdown}, \code{slice_pushdown},
\code{comm_subplan_elim}, \code{comm_subexpr_elim}.}

\item{inherit_optimization}{Boolean. Use existing optimization settings
regardless the settings specified in this function call.}
}
\description{
This writes the output of a query directly to an Arrow IPC file without collecting
it in the R session first. This is useful if the output of the query is still
larger than RAM as it would crash the R session if it was collected into R.

\examples{
# sink table 'mtcars' from mem to ipc
tmpf = tempfile()
pl$LazyFrame(mtcars)$sink_ipc(tmpf)

# stream a query end-to-end (not supported yet, https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/1040)
# tmpf2 = tempfile()
# pl$scan_ipc(tmpf)$select(pl$col("cyl") * 2)$sink_ipc(tmpf2)

# load ipc directly into a DataFrame / memory
# pl$scan_ipc(tmpf2)$collect()
}

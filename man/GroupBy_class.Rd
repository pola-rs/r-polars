Operations on Polars grouped DataFrame
}
\details{
The GroupBy class in R, is just another interface on top of the DataFrame(R wrapper class) in
rust polars. Groupby does not use the rust api for groupby+agg because the groupby-struct is a
reference to a DataFrame and that reference will share lifetime with its parent DataFrame. There
is no way to expose lifetime limited objects via extendr currently (might be quirky anyhow with R
GC). Instead the inputs for the groupby are just stored on R side, until also agg is called.
Which will end up in a self-owned DataFrame object and all is fine. groupby aggs are performed
via the rust polars LazyGroupBy methods, see DataFrame.groupby_agg method.

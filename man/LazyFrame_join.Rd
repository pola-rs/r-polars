\usage{
LazyFrame_join(
  other,
  on = NULL,
  how = c("inner", "left", "outer", "semi", "anti", "cross", "outer_coalesce"),
  ...,
  left_on = NULL,

  suffix = "_right",
  validate = "m:m",
  join_nulls = FALSE,
  allow_parallel = TRUE,
  force_parallel = FALSE,
  coalesce = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{other}{LazyFrame to join with.}

\item{on}{Either a vector of column names or a list of expressions and/or
strings. Use \code{left_on} and \code{right_on} if the column names to match on are
different between the two DataFrames.}

\item{how}{One of the following methods: "inner", "left", "outer", "semi",
"anti", "cross", "outer_coalesce".}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{left_on, right_on}{Same as \code{on} but only for the left or the right
DataFrame. They must have the same length.}

\item{suffix}{Suffix to add to duplicated column names.}

\item{validate}{Checks if join is of specified type:
\itemize{
\item \code{"m:m"} (default): many-to-many, doesn't perform any checks;
\item \code{"1:1"}: one-to-one, check if join keys are unique in both left and right
datasets;
\item \code{"1:m"}: one-to-many, check if join keys are unique in left dataset
\item \code{"m:1"}: many-to-one, check if join keys are unique in right dataset
}

Note that this is currently not supported by the streaming engine, and is
only supported when joining by single columns.}

\item{join_nulls}{Join on null values. By default null values will never
produce matches.}

\item{allow_parallel}{Allow the physical plan to optionally evaluate the
computation of both DataFrames up to the join in parallel.}

\item{force_parallel}{Force the physical plan to evaluate the computation of
both DataFrames up to the join in parallel.}

\item{coalesce}{Coalescing behavior (merging of join columns).
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL}: join specific.
\item \code{TRUE}: Always coalesce join columns.
\item \code{FALSE}: Never coalesce join columns.
}}

LazyFrame

\description{
This function can do both mutating joins (adding columns based on matching
observations, for example with \code{how = "left"}) and filtering joins (keeping
observations based on matching observations, for example with \code{how = "inner"}).
}
\examples{
# inner join by default
df1 = pl$LazyFrame(list(key = 1:3, payload = c("f", "i", NA)))
df2 = pl$LazyFrame(list(key = c(3L, 4L, 5L, NA_integer_)))
df1$join(other = df2, on = "key")

# cross join
df1 = pl$LazyFrame(x = letters[1:3])
df2 = pl$LazyFrame(y = 1:4)
df1$join(other = df2, how = "cross")

# use "validate" to ensure join keys are not duplicated
df1 = pl$LazyFrame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5)
df2 = pl$LazyFrame(x = c("a", letters[1:4]), y2 = 6:10)

# this throws an error because there are two keys in df2 that match the key
# in df1
tryCatch(
  df1$join(df2, on = "x", validate = "1:1")$collect(),
  error = function(e) print(e)
)

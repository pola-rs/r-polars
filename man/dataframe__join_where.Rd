\title{Perform a join based on one or multiple (in)equality predicates}
\usage{
dataframe__join_where(other, ..., suffix = "_right")
}
\arguments{
\item{other}{DataFrame to join with.}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[rlang:dyn-dots]{dynamic-dots}}> (In)Equality condition to
join the two tables on. When a column name occurs in both tables, the proper
suffix must be applied in the predicate. For example, if both tables have a
column \code{"x"} that you want to use in the conditions, you must refer to the
column of the right table as \code{"x<suffix>"}.}

\item{suffix}{Suffix to append to columns with a duplicate name.}
}
\value{
A polars \link{DataFrame}
}

This performs an inner join, so only rows where all predicates are true are
included in the result, and a row from either DataFrame may be included
multiple times in the result.

Note that the row order of the input DataFrames is not preserved.

\arguments{
\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{format}{The format to use for displaying the logical plan. Must be
either \code{"plain"} (default) or \code{"tree"}.}

\item{optimized}{Return an optimized query plan. If \code{TRUE} (default), the
subsequent optimization flags control which optimizations run.}

\item{type_coercion}{A logical, indicates type coercion optimization.}

\item{predicate_pushdown}{A logical, indicates predicate pushdown optimization.}

\item{projection_pushdown}{A logical, indicates projection pushdown optimization.}

\item{simplify_expression}{A logical, indicates simplify expression optimization.}

\item{slice_pushdown}{A logical, indicates slice pushdown optimization.}

\item{comm_subplan_elim}{A logical, indicates trying to cache branching subplans that occur
on self-joins or unions.}

\item{comm_subexpr_elim}{A logical, indicates trying to cache common subexpressions.}

\item{cluster_with_columns}{A logical, indicates to combine sequential independent calls
to with_columns.}

\item{collapse_joins}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}
Use \code{predicate_pushdown} instead.}

\item{_check_order, _type_check}{For internal use only.}
}
\value{
A character value containing the query plan.
}
\description{
The query plan is read from bottom to top. When \code{optimized = FALSE}, the
query as it was written by the user is shown. This is not what Polars runs.
Instead, it applies optimizations that are displayed by default by \verb{$explain()}.
One classic example is the predicate pushdown, which applies the filter as
early as possible (i.e. at the bottom of the plan).
}
\examples{
lazy_frame <- as_polars_lf(iris)

# Prepare your query
lazy_query <- lazy_frame$sort("Species")$filter(pl$col("Species") != "setosa")

# This is the query that was written by the user, without any optimizations
# (use cat() for better printing)
lazy_query$explain(optimized = FALSE) |> cat()

# This is the query after `polars` optimizes it: instead of sorting first and
# then filtering, it is faster to filter first and then sort the rest.
lazy_query$explain() |> cat()

# Also possible to see this as tree format
lazy_query$explain(format = "tree") |> cat()
}

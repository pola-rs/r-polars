\title{Inner workings of the Series-class}
\description{
The \code{Series}-class is simply two environments of respectively
the public and private methods/function calls to the polars rust side. The instanciated
\code{Series}-object is an \code{externalptr} to a lowlevel rust polars Series  object. The pointer address
is the only statefullness of the Series object on the R side. Any other state resides on the
rust side. The S3 method \code{.DollarNames.Series} exposes all public \verb{$foobar()}-methods which are callable onto the object.
Most methods return another \code{Series}-class instance or similar which allows for method chaining.
This class system in lack of a better name could be called "environment classes" and is the same class
system extendr provides, except here there is both a public and private set of methods. For implementation
reasons, the private methods are external and must be called from polars:::.pr.$Series$methodname(), also
all private methods must take any self as an argument, thus they are pure functions. Having the private methods
as pure functions solved/simplified self-referential complications.

\details{
Check out the source code in R/Series_frame.R how public methods are derived from private methods.
Check out  extendr-wrappers.R to see the extendr-auto-generated methods. These are moved to .pr and converted
into pure external functions in after-wrappers.R. In zzz.R (named zzz to be last file sourced) the extendr-methods
are removed and replaced by any function prefixed \code{Series_}.

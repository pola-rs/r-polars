\alias{LazyFrame_join_where}
\title{Perform a join based on one or multiple (in)equality predicates}
\usage{
LazyFrame_join_where(other, ..., suffix = "_right")
}
\arguments{
\item{other}{LazyFrame to join with.}

\item{...}{(In)Equality condition to join the two tables on. When a column
name occurs in both tables, the proper suffix must be applied in the
predicate. For example, if both tables have a column \code{"x"} that you want to
use in the conditions, you must refer to the column of the right table as
\code{"x<suffix>"}.}

\item{suffix}{Suffix to append to columns with a duplicate name.}
}
\description{
This performs an inner join, so only rows where all predicates are true are
included in the result, and a row from either LazyFrame may be included
multiple times in the result.

Note that the row order of the input LazyFrames is not preserved.

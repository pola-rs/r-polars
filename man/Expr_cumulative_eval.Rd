\usage{
Expr_cumulative_eval(expr, min_periods = 1L, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{Expression to evaluate}

\item{min_periods}{Number of valid values there should be in the window before the expression
is evaluated. valid values = \code{length - null_count}}

\item{parallel}{Run in parallel. Don't do this in a groupby or another operation that
already has much parallelization.}

}
\description{
Run an expression over a sliding window that increases \code{1} slot every iteration.

Warnings

This functionality is experimental and may change without it being considered a
breaking change.
This can be really slow as it can have \code{O(n^2)} complexity. Don't use this
for operations that visit all elements.

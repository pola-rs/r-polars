\title{Return the last n characters of each string}
\usage{
expr_str_tail(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Length of the slice (integer or expression). Strings are parsed as
column names. Negative indexing is supported.}
}
\value{
A polars \link{expression}
}
\description{
Return the last n characters of each string
}
\details{
The \code{n} input is defined in terms of the number of characters in the (UTF-8)
string. A character is defined as a Unicode scalar value. A single character
is represented by a single byte when working with ASCII text, and a maximum
of 4 bytes otherwise.

When the \code{n} input is negative, \code{tail()} returns characters starting from the
\code{n}th from the beginning of the string. For example, if \code{n = -3}, then all
characters except the first three are returned.

If the length of the string has fewer than \code{n} characters, the full string is
returned.

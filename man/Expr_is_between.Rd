\usage{
Expr_is_between(start, end, include_bounds = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{Lower bound as primitive or datetime}

\item{end}{Lower bound as primitive or datetime}

\item{include_bounds}{bool vector or scalar:
FALSE:           Exclude both start and end (default).
TRUE:            Include both start and end.
c(FALSE, FALSE):  Exclude start and exclude end.
c(TRUE, TRUE):    Include start and include end.
c(FALSE, TRUE):   Exclude start and include end.
c(TRUE, FALSE):   Include start and exclude end.}

\value{
Expr

\description{
Check if this expression is between start and end.
}
\details{
alias the column to 'in_between'
This function is equivalent to a combination of < <= >= and the &-and operator.

\examples{
df = pl$DataFrame(list(num = 1:5))
df$select(pl$col("num")$is_between(2,4))
df$select(pl$col("num")$is_between(2,4,TRUE))
df$select(pl$col("num")$is_between(2,4,c(FALSE, TRUE)))
#start end can be a vector/expr with same length as column
df$select(pl$col("num")$is_between(c(0,2,3,3,3),6))

\title{Inner workings of the DataFrame-class}
\description{
The \code{DataFrame}-class is simply two environments of respectively
the public and private methods/function calls to the polars Rust side. The
instantiated \code{DataFrame}-object is an \code{externalptr} to a low-level Rust
polars DataFrame object.

The S3 method \code{.DollarNames.RPolarsDataFrame} exposes all public
\verb{$foobar()}-methods which are callable onto the object. Most methods return
another \code{DataFrame}- class instance or similar which allows for method
chaining. This class system could be called "environment classes" (in lack
of a better name) and is the same class system \code{extendr} provides, except
here there are both a public and private set of methods. For implementation
reasons, the private methods are external and must be called from
\code{.pr$DataFrame$methodname()}. Also, all private methods must take any
\code{self} as an argument, thus they are pure functions. Having the private
methods as pure functions solved/simplified self-referential complications.

\details{
Check out the source code in
\href{https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/blob/main/R/dataframe__frame.R}{R/dataframe_frame.R}
to see how public methods are derived from private methods. Check out
\href{https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/blob/main/R/extendr-wrappers.R}{extendr-wrappers.R}
to see the \code{extendr}-auto-generated methods. These are moved to \code{.pr} and
converted into pure external functions in
\href{https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/blob/main/R/after-wrappers.R}{after-wrappers.R}.
In \href{https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/blob/main/R/zzz.R}{zzz.R} (named
\code{zzz} to be last file sourced) the \code{extendr}-methods are removed and
replaced by any function prefixed \code{DataFrame_}.

\section{Active bindings}{

\subsection{columns}{

\verb{$columns} returns a character vector with the column names.
}

\subsection{dtypes}{

\verb{$dtypes} returns a unnamed list with the \link[=pl_dtypes]{data type} of each column.
}

\subsection{flags}{

\verb{$flags} returns a nested list with column names at the top level and
column flags in each sublist.

Flags are used internally to avoid doing unnecessary computations, such as
sorting a variable that we know is already sorted. The number of flags
varies depending on the column type: columns of type \code{array} and \code{list}
have the flags \code{SORTED_ASC}, \code{SORTED_DESC}, and \code{FAST_EXPLODE}, while other
column types only have the former two.
\itemize{
\item \code{SORTED_ASC} is set to \code{TRUE} when we sort a column in increasing order, so
that we can use this information later on to avoid re-sorting it.
\item \code{SORTED_DESC} is similar but applies to sort in decreasing order.
}
}

\subsection{height}{

\verb{$height} returns the number of rows in the DataFrame.
}

\subsection{schema}{

\verb{$schema} returns a named list with the \link[=pl_dtypes]{data type} of each column.
}

\subsection{shape}{

\verb{$shape} returns a numeric vector of length two with the number of rows and
the number of columns.
}

\subsection{width}{

\verb{$width} returns the number of columns in the DataFrame.

\examples{
# see all public exported method names (normally accessed via a class
# instance with $)
ls(.pr$env$RPolarsDataFrame)

# see all private methods (not intended for regular use)
ls(.pr$DataFrame)

# make an object
df = as_polars_df(iris)

# call an active binding
df$shape

# use a private method, which has mutability
result = .pr$DataFrame$set_column_from_robj(df, 150:1, "some_ints")

# Column exists in both dataframes-objects now, as they are just pointers to
# the same object
# There are no public methods with mutability.
df2 = df

df$columns
df2$columns

# Show flags
df$sort("Sepal.Length")$flags

# set_column_from_robj-method is fallible and returned a result which could
# be "ok" or an error.
# No public method or function will ever return a result.
# The `result` is very close to the same as output from functions decorated
# with purrr::safely.
# To use results on the R side, these must be unwrapped first such that
# potentially errors can be thrown. `unwrap(result)` is a way to communicate
# errors happening on the Rust side to the R side. `Extendr` default behavior
# is to use `panic!`(s) which would cause some unnecessarily confusing and
# some very verbose error messages on the inner workings of rust.
# `unwrap(result)` in this case no error, just a NULL because this mutable
# method does not return any ok-value.

# Try unwrapping an error from polars due to unmatching column lengths
err_result = .pr$DataFrame$set_column_from_robj(df, 1:10000, "wrong_length")
tryCatch(unwrap(err_result, call = NULL), error = \(e) cat(as.character(e)))

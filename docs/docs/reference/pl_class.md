# The complete polars public API.

## Format

An object of class `environment` of length 57.

```r
pl
```

`pl`-object is a environment of all public functions and class constructors. Public functions are not exported as a normal package as it would be huge namespace collision with base:: and other functions. All object-methods are accessed with object$method() via the new class functions.

Having all functions in an namespace is similar to the rust- and python- polars api.

## Details

If someone do not particularly like the letter combination `pl`, they are free to bind the environment to another variable name as `simon_says = pl` or even do `attach(pl)`

## Examples

```r
#how to use polars via `pl`
pl$col("colname")$sum() / pl$lit(42L)  #expression ~ chain-method / literal-expression

#pl inventory
polars:::print_env(pl,"polars public functions")

#all accessible classes and their public methods
polars:::print_env(
  polars:::pl_pub_class_env,
  "polars public class methods, access via object$method()"
)
```

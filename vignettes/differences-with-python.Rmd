We try to mimic the Python Polars API as much as possible so that one can quickly
switch and copy code between the two languages with as little adjustments to make
as possible (most of the time switching `.` and `$`).

Still, there are a few places where the API diverges. This is often due to 
differences in the language itself. This vignette provides a list of those
differences.

## 64-bit integers

Extra arg to see how to convert 64-bit integers from polars to R.

## Structs and objects

Prefer the `as_` functions

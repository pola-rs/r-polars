## What is rpolars

rpolars is an unofficial porting of polars (pola-rs) in to an R package. I aim to finish the project in 2022. Beta should be ready by the end of September 2022.

[Polars](<http://pola.rs>) is the [fastest](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/) data table query library.  The syntax is related to Spark, but column oriented and not row oriented. All R libraries are also column oriented so this should feel familiar. Unlike Spark, polars is natively multithreaded instead of multinode(d). This make polars simple to install and use as any other R package. Like Spark and SQL-variants polars optimizes queries for memory consuption and speed so you don't have to. Expect 5-10 speedup compared to dplyr on simple transformations from >500Mb data. When chaining many operations the speedup due to optimization can be even higher. Polars is built on the apache-arrow memory model.

This port relies on extendr <https://github.com/extendr> which is the R equivalent to pyo3+maturin. Extendr is very convenient for calling rust from R and the reverse.


## Hello world
```{r}
#loading the package rpolars only exposes a few functions 
library(rpolars)

#all constructors are accessed via pl

#Here we go, Hello world written with polars expressions
pl$col("hello")$sum()$over("world","from")$alias("polars")

```

## Typical ussage

Where `dplyr` has `%>%`-piping and ``data.table` has `[,]`-indexing, method chaining `object$m1()$m2()` is the bread and butter syntax of polars. For now the best learning material to understand the syntax and the power of polars is the [official user guide for python]( https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/). As rpolars syntax is the same ( except `$` instead of `.`) the guide should be quite useful. The following example shows a typical 'polar_frame' method together with chained expressions.
```{r iris}
#create polar_frames from iris
df = pl$DataFrame(iris)

#make selection (similar to dplyr mutute() and data.table [,.()] ) and use expressions or strings.

df = df$select(
  pl$col("Sepal.Width")$sum()$over("Species")$alias("sw_sum_over_species"),
  pl$col("Sepal.Length")$sum()$over("Species")$alias("sl_sum_over_species"),
  "Petal.Width"
)

#polars expressions are column instructions

#1 take the column named Sepal.Width
#2 sum it...
#3 over(by) the column  Species
#4 rename/alias to sw_sum_over_species


#convert back to data.frame
head(df$as_data_frame())


```


## `polar_frame` from `series` and R vectors
```{r mix_values}
#a single column outside a polars_frame is called a series
pl$Series((1:5) * 5,"my_series")

#Create polar_From  from a list of series and/or plain R vectors.
values = list (
  newname = pl$Series(c(1,2,3,4,5),name = "b"), #overwrite name b with 'newname'
  pl$Series((1:5) * 5,"a"),
  pl$Series(letters[1:5],"b"),
  c(5,4,3,2,1), #unnamed vector
  named_vector = c(15,14,13,12,11) ,#named provide
  c(5,4,3,2,0)
)

pl$DataFrame(values)
```


# Data types
```{r datatypes}
#polars is strongly typed. Data-types can be created like this:
pl$dtypes$Float64
pl$dtypes$Int32
pl$dtypes$Int64 #not R native type


```


# Read csv and the `polars_lazy_frame`
```{r csv}
  #using iris.csv as example
  write.csv(iris, "iris.csv",row.names = FALSE)

  #read csv into a lazy_polar_frame and compute sum of Sepal.Width over Species
  lpf = pl$lazy_csv_reader("iris.csv")$select(
    pl$col("Sepal.Width")$sum()$over("Species")
  )
  
  #a lazy frame is only a tree of instructions
  print(lpf) #same as lpf$describe_plan()
  
  #read plan from bottom to top, says:  "read entire csv, then compute sum x over y"
  
  #what polars actually will do is the optimized plan
  
  lpf$describe_optimized_plan()
  
  #optimized plan says:  "read only column x and y from csv, compute sum x over y"
  
  #Only reading some columns or in other cases some row in to memory can save speed downstream operations. This is called peojection. 
  
  
  #to execute plan, simply call $collect() and get a polars_frame as result
  
  lpf$collect()
  
```

## User pass user defined functions to polars
It is possible to mix R code with polars by passing user defined functions to polars. User defined functions are slower. Use native polar functions/expressions where possible.
```{r udf}
  
    pl$DataFrame(iris)$select(
      pl$col("Sepal.Length")$map(\(s) {
        x = s$to_r_vector() #convert from Series to a native R vector
        x[x>=5] = 10
        x[1:10] # if return is R vector, it will automatically be converted to Series again
      })
    )$as_data_frame()
    

```

## Polars R Package (development version)

### Breaking changes due to Rust-polars update

- rust-polars is updated to 0.38.3 (#937).
  - New argument `non_existent` in `$dt$replace_time_zone()` to specify what should
    happen when a datetime doesn't exist.
  - In rolling aggregation functions (such as `$rolling_mean()`), the default
    value of argument `closed` now is `NULL`. Using `closed` with a fixed
    `window_size` now throws an error.

### Other breaking changes

- Several functions have been rewritten to match the behavior of Python Polars.

  - In `pl$Series()` arguments are changed.

    - The argument `x` is renamed `values` (#933).
    - The argument `values` has a new default value `NULL` (#966).
    - Using positional arguments in `pl$Series()` throws a warning, since the
      argument positions will be changed in the future (#966).

      ```r
      # polars 0.15.1 or earlier
      # The first argument is `x`, the second argument is `name`.
      pl$Series(1:3, "foo")

      # The code above will warn in 0.16.0
      # Use named arguments to silence the warning.
      pl$Series(values = 1:3, name = "foo")
      pl$Series(name = "foo", values = 1:3)

      # polars 0.17.0 or later (future version)
      # The first argument is `name`, the second argument is `values`.
      pl$Series("foo", 1:3)
      ```

      This warning can also be silenced by replacing `pl$Series(<values>, <name>)`
      by `as_polars_series(<values>, <name>)`.

  - `pl$implode(...)` is rewritten to be a syntactic sugar for `pl$col(...)$implode()` (#923).
  - Unify names of input/output function arguments (#935).
    - All arguments except the first argument must be named arguments.
    - In `pl$read_*` and `pl$scan_*` functions, the first argument is now `source`.
    - In `<DataFrame>$write_*` functions, the first argument is now `file`.
    - In `<LazyFrame>$sink_*` functions, the first argument is now `path`.
  - In `$dt$convert_time_zone()` and `$dt$replace_time_zone()`, the `tz` argument
    is renamed to `time_zone` (#944).
  - In `<DataFrame>$rolling()`, `<LazyFrame>$rolling()`, `<DataFrame>$group_by_dynamic()`
    and `<LazyFrame>$group_by_dynamic()`, the `by` argument is renamed to `group_by` (#983).
  - In `<DataFrame>$rolling()` and `<DataFrame>$group_by_dynamic()`, all arguments
    except `index_column` must be named arguments (#983).
  - In `$dt$replace_time_zone()`, all arguments except `time_zone` must be named
    arguments (#944).
  - In `$bin$decode()`, the `strict` argument must be a named argument (#980).
  - `pl$date_range()` is completely rewritten (#950).
    - The argument `end` must be specified.
    - The default value of `interval` is changed to `"1d"`.
    - The unused argument (not working in recent versions) `explode` is removed.
    - The arguments `closed`, `time_unit`, and `time_zone` must be named arguments.
    - No longer accepts numeric values to `start` and `end`.
    - The usage of `pl$date_range()` to create a range of `Datetime` data type is deprecated.
      `pl$date_range()` will always create a range of `Date` data type in the future.
      Please use `pl$datetime_range()` if you want to create a range of `Datetime` instead.
    - `<DataFrame>$get_columns()` now returns an unnamed list instead of a named list (#991).

- The argument `columns` in `$drop()` is removed. `$drop()` now accepts several
  character scalars, such as `$drop("a", "b", "c")` (#912).
- In `pl$col()`, the `name` argument is removed, and the `...` argument no longer
  accepts a list of characters and `RPolarsSeries` class objects (#923).
- Removed `$argsort()` which was an old alias for `$arg_sort()` (#930).
- Removed `pl$expr_to_r()` which was an alias for `$to_r()` (#938).
- `<Series>$to_r_list()` is renamed `<Series>$to_list()` (#938).
- Removed `<Series>$to_r_vector()` which was an old alias for
  `<Series>$to_vector()` (#938).
- In `$str$contains()`, the arguments `literal` and `strict` should be named arguments (#982).
- In `$str$contains_any()`, the `ascii_case_insensitive` argument must be named (#986).
- In `$str$count_matches()`, `$str$replace()` and `$str$replace_all()`,
  the `literal` argument must be named (#987).
- In `$str$strptime()`, `$str$to_date()`, `$str$to_datetime()`, and
  `$str$to_time()`, all arguments (except the first one) must be named (#939).
- In `$str$strptime()`, the argument `datatype` is renamed `dtype` (#939).
- `$unique()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` have several changes (#953):
  - New default value `"any"` for argument `keep`.
  - Arguments `keep` and `maintain_order` must be named.
- The following deprecated functions are now removed: `pl$threadpool_size()`,
  `<DataFrame>$with_row_count()`, `<LazyFrame>$with_row_count()` (#965).

### New features

- New functions `pl$datetime()`, `pl$date()`, and `pl$time()` to easily create
  Expr of class datetime, date, and time via columns and literals (#918).
- New function `pl$arg_where()` to get the indices that match a condition (#922).
- New function `is_polars_dtype()` (#927).
- New function `pl$datetime_range()` (#950).
- New method `<LazyFrame>$to_dot()` to print the query plan of a LazyFrame with
  graphviz dot syntax (#928).
- Argument `ambiguous` can now take the value `"null"` to convert ambigous
  datetimes to null values (#937).
- New function `pl$mean_horizontal()` (#959).
- New argument `raise_if_undetermined` of `<Expr>$meta$output_name()` (#961).
- New function `pl$arg_sort_by()` (#929).
- New functions `pl$date_ranges()` and `pl$datetime_ranges()` (#962).
- Export the `Duration` datatype (#955).
- New functions `pl$int_range()` and `pl$int_ranges()` (#968).
- New string method `$str$extract_groups()` (#979).
- New string method `$str$find()` (#985).
- New argument `n` in `$str$replace()` (#987).
- Method `$over()` gains an argument `mapping_strategy` (#984, #988).
- New method `$item()` for `DataFrame` and `Series` (#992).

### Bug fixes

- The `join_nulls` and `validate` arguments of `<DataFrame>$join()` now work
  correctly (#945).
- We said in the changelog of 0.14.0 that all `row_count_*` args in I/O functions
  were renamed `row_index_*`, but this change was not made for CSV and IPC
  functions. This renaming is now made (#964).
- Evaluating `Series` methods from `Expr` inside functions now works correctly (#973).
  Thanks @Yunuuuu for the report.
- The dependent crate `extendr-api` is updated to 2024-03-31 unreleased version (#995).
  The issue that the R session crashes when a panic occurs in the Rust side is resolved.
  Thanks @CGMossa for the upstream fix.

## Polars R Package 0.15.1

### New features

- rust-polars is updated to 0.38.2 (#907).
  - Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.76.0.
- `as_polars_df(<nanoarrow_array>)` is added (#893).
- It is now possible to create an empty `DataFrame` with a specific schema
  with `pl$DataFrame(schema = my_schema)` (#901).
- New arguments `dtype` and `nan_to_null` for `pl$Series()` (#902).
- New method `<DataFrame>$partition_by()` (#898).

### Bug fixes

- The default value of the `format` of `$str$strptime()` is now correctly set (#892).

### Other improvements

- Performance of `as_polars_df(<nanoarrow_array_stream>)` is improved (#896).

## Polars R Package 0.15.0

### Breaking changes due to Rust-polars update

- rust-polars is updated to 0.38.1 (#865, #872).
  - in `$pivot()`, arguments `aggregate_function`, `maintain_order`,
    `sort_columns` and `separator` must be named. Values that are passed
    by position are ignored.
  - in `$describe()`, the name of the first column changed from `"describe"`
    to `"statistic"`.
  - `$mod()` methods and `%%` works correctly to guarantee
    `x == (x %% y) + y * (x %/% y)`.

### Other breaking changes

- Removed `as.list()` for class `RPolarsExpr` as it is a simple wrapper around
  `list()` (#843).
- Several functions have been rewritten to match the behavior of Python Polars.
  - `pl$col(...)` requires at least one argument. (#852)
  - `pl$head()`, `pl$tail()`, `pl$count()`, `pl$first()`, `pl$last()`, `pl$max()`,
    `pl$min()`, `pl$mean()`, `pl$media()`, `pl$std()`, `pl$sum()`, `pl$var()`,
    `pl$n_unique()`, and `pl$approx_n_unique()` are syntactic sugar for
    `pl$col(...)$<method()>`. The argument `...` now only accepts characters,
    that are either column names or regular expressions (#852).
  - There is no argument for `pl$len()`. If you want to measure the length of
    specific columns, you should use `pl$count(...)` (#852).
  - `<Expr>$str$concat()` method's `delimiter` argument's default value is
    changed from `"-"` to `""` (#853).
  - `<Expr>$str$concat()` method's `ignore_nulls` argument must be a
    named argument (#853).
  - `pl$Datetime()`'s arguments are renamed: `tu` to `time_unit`,
    and `tz` to `time_zone` (#887).
- `pl$Categorical()` has been improved to allow specifying the `ordering` type
  (either lexical or physical). This also means that calling `pl$Categorical`
  doesn't create a `DataType` anymore. All calls to `pl$Categorical` must be
  replaced by `pl$Categorical()` (#860).
- `<Series>$rem()` is removed. Use `<Series>$mod()` instead (#886).
- The conversion strategy between the POSIXct type without time zone attribute
  and Polars datetime has been changed (#878).
  `POSIXct` class vectors without a time zone attribute have UTC time internally
  and is displayed based on the system's time zone. Previous versions of `polars`
  only considered the internal value and interpreted it as UTC time, so the
  time displayed as `POSIXct` and in Polars was different.

  ```r
  # polars 0.14.1
  Sys.setenv(TZ = "Europe/Paris")
  datetime = as.POSIXct("1900-01-01")
  datetime
  #> [1] "1900-01-01 PMT"

  s = polars::as_polars_series(datetime)
  s
  #> polars Series: shape: (1,)
  #> Series: '' [datetime[ms]]
  #> [
  #>  1899-12-31 23:50:39
  #> ]

  as.vector(s)
  #> [1] "1900-01-01 PMT"
  ```

  Now the internal value is updated to match the displayed value.

  ```r
  # polars 0.15.0
  Sys.setenv(TZ = "Europe/Paris")
  datetime = as.POSIXct("1900-01-01")
  datetime
  #> [1] "1900-01-01 PMT"

  s = polars::as_polars_series(datetime)
  s
  #> polars Series: shape: (1,)
  #> Series: '' [datetime[ms]]
  #> [
  #>  1900-01-01 00:00:00
  #> ]

  as.vector(s)
  #> [1] "1900-01-01 PMT"
  ```

  This update may cause errors when converting from Polars to `POSIXct` for non-existent
  or ambiguous times. It is recommended to explicitly add a time zone before converting
  from Polars to R.

  ```r
  Sys.setenv(TZ = "America/New_York")
  ambiguous_time = as.POSIXct("2020-11-01 01:00:00")
  ambiguous_time
  #> [1] "2020-11-01 01:00:00 EDT"

  pls = polars::as_polars_series(ambiguous_time)
  pls
  #> polars Series: shape: (1,)
  #> Series: '' [datetime[ms]]
  #> [
  #>  2020-11-01 01:00:00
  #> ]

  ## This will be error!
  # pls |> as.vector()

  pls$dt$replace_time_zone("UTC") |> as.vector()
  #> [1] "2020-11-01 01:00:00 UTC"
  ```

- Removed argument `eager` in `pl$date_range()` and `pl$struct()` for more
  consistency of output. It is possible to replace `eager = TRUE` by calling
  `$to_series()` (#882).

### New features

- In the when-then-otherwise expressions, the last `$otherwise()` is now optional,
  as in Python Polars. If `$otherwise()` is not specified, rows that don't respect
  the condition set in `$when()` will be filled with `null` (#836).
- `<DataFrame>$head()` and `<DataFrame>$tail()` methods now support negative
  row numbers (#840).
- `$group_by()` now works with named expressions (#846).
- New methods for the `arr` subnamespace: `$median()`, `$var()`, `$std()`,
  `$shift()`, `$to_struct()` (#867).
- `$min()` and `max()` now work on categorical variables (#868).
- New methods for the `list` subnamespace: `$n_unique()`, `$gather_every()`
  (#869).
- Converts `clock_time_point` and `clock_zoned_time` objects from
  the `{clock}` package to Polars datetime type (#861).
- New methods for the `name` subnamespace: `$prefix_fields()` and
  `suffix_fields()` (#873).
- `pl$Datetime()`'s `time_zone` argument now accepts `"*"` to match
  any time zone (#887).

### Bug fixes

- R no longer crashes when calling an invalid Polars object that points
  to a null pointer (#874). This was occurring, such as when a Polars object
  was saved in an RDS file and loaded from another session.

## Polars R Package 0.14.1

### Breaking changes

- Since most of the methods of `Expr` are now available for `Series`, the
  experimental `<Series>$expr` subnamespace is removed (#831).
  Use `<Series>$<method>` instead of `<Series>$expr$<method>`.

### New features

- New active bindings `$flags` for `DataFrame` to show the flags used internally
  for each column. The output of `$flags` for `Series` was also improved and now
  contains `FAST_EXPLODE` for `Series` of type `list` and `array` (#809).
- Most of `Expr` methods are also available for `Series` (#819, #828, #831).
- `as_polars_df()` for `data.frame` is more memory-efficient and new arguments
  `schema` and `schema_overrides` are added (#817).
- Use `polars_code_completion_activate()` to enable code suggestions and
  autocompletion after `$` on polars objects. This is an experimental feature
  that is disabled by default. For now, it is only supported in the native R
  terminal and in RStudio (#597).

### Bug fixes

- `<Series>$list` sub namespace methods returns `Series` class object correctly (#819).

## Polars R Package 0.14.0

### Breaking changes due to Rust-polars update

- rust-polars is updated to 0.37.0 (#776).
  - Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.74.1.
  - `$with_row_count()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` is deprecated and
    will be removed in 0.15.0. It is replaced by `$with_row_index()`.
  - `pl$count()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.15.0. It is replaced
    by `pl$len()`.
  - `$explode()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` doesn't work anymore on
    string columns.
  - `$list$join()` and `pl$concat_str()` gain an argument `ignore_nulls`.
    The current behavior is to return a `null` if the row contains any `null`.
    Setting `ignore_nulls = TRUE` changes that.
  - All `row_count_*` args in reading/scanning functions are renamed
    `row_index_*`.
  - `$sort()` for `Series` gains an argument `nulls_last`.
  - `$str$extract()` and `$str$zfill()` now accept an `Expr` and parse
    strings as column names. Use `pl$lit()` to recover the old behavior.
  - `$cum_count()` now starts from 1 instead of 0.

### Other breaking changes

- The `simd` feature of the Rust library is removed in favor of
  the new `nightly` feature (#800).
  If you specified `simd` via the `LIBR_POLARS_FEATURES` environment variable
  during source installations, please use `nightly` instead;
  there is no change if you specified `full_features` because
  it now contains `nightly` instead of `simd`.
- The following functions were deprecated in 0.13.0 and are now removed (#783):
  - `$list$lengths()` -> `$list$len()`
  - `pl$from_arrow()` -> `as_polars_df()` or `as_polars_series()`
  - `pl$set_options()` and `pl$reset_options()` -> `polars_options()`
- `$is_between()` had several changes (#788):
  - arguments `start` and `end` are renamed `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`.
    Their behaviour doesn't change.
  - `include_bounds` is renamed `closed` and must be one of `"left"`,
    `"right"`, `"both"`, or `"none"`.
- `polars_info()` returns a slightly changed list.
  - `$threadpool_size`, which means the number of threads used by Polars,
    is changed to `$thread_pool_size` (#784)
  - `$version`, which indicates the version of this package,
    is changed to `$versions$r_package` (#791).
  - `$rust_polars`, which indicates the version of the dependent Rust Polars,
    is changed to `$versions$rust_crate` (#791).
- New behavior when creating a `DataFrame` with a single list-variable.
  `pl$DataFrame(x = list(1:2, 3:4))` used to create a `DataFrame` with two
  columns named "new_column" and "new_column_1", which was unexpected. It now
  produces a `DataFrame` with a single `list` variable. This also applies to
  list-column created in `$with_columns()` and `$select()` (#794).

### Deprecations

- `pl$threadpool_size()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.15.0. Use
  `pl$thread_pool_size()` instead (#784).

### New features

- Implementation of the subnamespace `$arr` for expressions on `array`-type
  columns. An `array` column is similar to a `list` column, but is stricter as
  each sub-array must have the same number of elements (#790).

### Other improvements

- The `sql` feature is included in the default feature (#800).
  This means that functionality related to the `RPolarsSQLContext` class
  is now always included in the binary package.

## Polars R Package 0.13.1

### New features

- New method `$write_parquet()` for DataFrame (#758).
- S3 methods of `as.data.frame()` for `RPolarsDataFrame` and `RPolarsLazyFrame`
  accepts more arguments of `as_polars_df()` and `<DataFrame>$to_data_frame()` (#762).
- S3 methods of `arrow::as_arrow_table()` and `arrow::as_record_batch_reader()` for
  `RPolarsDataFrame` no longer need the `{nanoarrow}` package (#754).
- Some S3 methods for the `{nanoarrow}` package are added (#730).
  - `as_polars_df(<nanoarrow_array_stream>)`
  - `as_polars_series(<nanoarrow_array>)`
  - `as_polars_series(<nanoarrow_array_stream>)`

### Bug fixes

- `$sort()` no longer panicks when `descending = NULL` (#748).

### Other enhancements

- `downlit::autolink()` now recognize the reference pages of this package (#739).

## Polars R Package 0.13.0

### Breaking changes

- `<Expr>$where()` is removed. Use `<Expr>$filter()` instead (#718).
- Deprecated functions from 0.12.x are removed (#714).
  - `<Expr>$apply()` and `<Expr>$map()`, use `$map_elements()` and
    `$map_batches()` instead.
  - `pl$polars_info()`, use `polars_info()` instead.
- The environment variables used when building the library have been changed
  (#693). This only affects selecting the feature flag and selecting profiles
  during source installation.
  - `RPOLARS_PROFILE` is renamed to `LIBR_POLARS_PROFILE`
  - `RPOLARS_FULL_FEATURES` is removed and `LIBR_POLARS_FEATURES` is added.
    To select the `full_features`, set `LIBR_POLARS_FEATURES="full_features"`.
  - `RPOLARS_RUST_SOURCE`, which was used for development, has been removed.
    If you want to use library binaries located elsewhere, use `LIBR_POLARS_PATH`
    instead.
- Remove the `eager` argument of `<SQLContext>$execute()`.
  Use the `$collect()` method after `$execute()` or `as_polars_df` to get the
  result as a `DataFrame`. (#719)
- The argument `name_generator` of `$list$to_struct()` is renamed `fields`
  (#724).
- The S3 method `[` for the `$list` subnamespace is removed (#724).
- The option `polars.df_print` has been renamed `polars.df_knitr_print` (#726).

### Deprecations

- `$list$lengths()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.14.0. Use
  `$list$len()` instead (#724).
- `pl$from_arrow()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.14.0.
  Use `as_polars_df()` or `as_polars_series()` instead (#728).
- `pl$set_options()` and `pl$reset_options()` are deprecated and will be
  removed in 0.14.0. See `?polars_options` for details (#726).

### New features

- For compatibility with CRAN, the number of threads used by Polars is automatically set to 2
  if the environment variable `POLARS_MAX_THREADS` is not set (#720).
  To disable this behavior and have the maximum number of threads used automatically,
  one of the following ways can be used:
  - Build the Rust library with the `disable_limit_max_threads` feature.
  - Set the `polars.limit_max_threads` option to `FALSE` with the `options()` function
    before loading the package.
- New method `$rolling()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame`. When this is
  applied, it creates an object of class `RPolarsRollingGroupBy` (#682, #694).
- New method `$group_by_dynamic()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame`. When this
  is applied, it creates an object of class `RPolarsDynamicGroupBy` (#691).
- New method `$sink_ndjson()` for LazyFrame (#681).
- New function `pl$duration()` to create a duration by components (week, day,
  hour, etc.), and use them with date(time) variables (#692).
- New methods `$list$any()` and `$list$all()` (#709).
- New function `pl$from_epoch()` to convert a Unix timestamp to a date(time)
  variable (#708).
- New methods for the `list` subnamespace: `$set_union()`, `$set_intersection()`,
  `$set_difference()`, `$set_symmetric_difference()` (#712).
- New option `int64_conversion` to specify how Int64 columns (that don't have
  equivalent in base R) should be converted. This option can either be set
  globally with `pl$set_options()` or on a case-by-case basis, e.g with
  `$to_data_frame(int64_conversion =)` (#706).
- Several changes in `$join()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` (#716):
  - `<LazyFrame>$join()` now errors if `other` is not a `LazyFrame` and
    `<DataFrame>$join()` errors if `other` is not a `DataFrame`.
  - Some arguments have been reordered (e.g `how` now comes before `left_on`).
    This can lead to bugs if the user didn't use argument names.
  - Argument `how` now accepts `"outer_coalesce"` to coalesce the join keys
    automatically after joining.
  - New argument `validate` to perform some checks on join keys (e.g ensure
    that there is a one-to-one matching between join keys).
  - New argument `join_nulls` to consider `null` values as a valid key.
- `<DataFrame>$describe()` now works with all datatypes. It also gains an
  `interpolation` argument that is used for quantiles computation (#717).
- `as_polars_df()` and `as_polars_series()` for the `arrow` package classes have been
  rewritten and work better (#727).
- Options handling has been rewritten to match the standard option handling in
  R (#726):
  - Options are now passed via `options()`. The option names don't change but
    they must be prefixed with `"polars."`. For example, we can now pass
    `options(polars.strictly_immutable = FALSE)`.
  - Options can be accessed with `polars_options()`, which returns a named
    list (this is the replacement of `pl$options`).
  - Options can be reset with `polars_options_reset()` (this is the
    replacement of `pl$reset_options()`).
- New function `polars_envvars()` to print the list of environment variables
  related to polars (#735).

## Polars R Package 0.12.2

This is a small release including a few documentation improvements and internal updates.

## Polars R Package 0.12.1

This version includes a few additional features and
a large amount of documentation improvements.

### Deprecations

- `pl$polars_info()` is moved to `polars_info()`. `pl$polars_info()` is deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.13.0 (#662).

### Rust-polars update

- rust-polars is updated to 0.36.2 (#659). Most of the changes from 0.35.x to 0.36.2
  were covered in R polars 0.12.0.
  The main change is that `pl$Utf8` is replaced by `pl$String`.
  `pl$Utf8` is an alias and will keep working, but `pl$String` is now preferred
  in the documentation and in new code.

### What's changed

- New methods `$str$reverse()`, `$str$contains_any()`, and `$str$replace_many()`
  (#641).
- New methods `$rle()` and `$rle_id()` (#648).
- New functions `is_polars_df()`, `is_polars_lf()`, `is_polars_series()` (#658).
- `$gather()` now accepts negative indexing (#659).

### Miscellaneous

- Remove the `Makefile` in favor of `Taskfile.yml`.
  Please use `task` instead of `make` as a task runner in the development (#654).

## Polars R Package 0.12.0

### BREAKING CHANGES DUE TO RUST-POLARS UPDATE

- rust-polars is updated to 2023-12-25 unreleased version (#601, #622).
  This is the same version of Python Polars package 0.20.2, so please check
  the [upgrade guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/releases/upgrade/0.20/) for details too.
  - `pl$scan_csv()` and `pl$read_csv()`'s `comment_char` argument is renamed `comment_prefix`.
  - `<DataFrame>$frame_equal()` and `<Series>$series_equal()` are renamed
    to `<DataFrame>$equals()` and `<Series>$equals()`.
  - `<Expr>$rolling_*` functions gained an argument `warn_if_unsorted`.
  - `<Expr>$str$json_extract()` is renamed to `<Expr>$str$json_decode()`.
  - Change default join behavior with regard to `null` values.
  - Preserve left and right join keys in outer joins.
  - `count` now ignores null values.
  - `NaN` values are now considered equal.
  - `$gather_every()` gained an argument `offset`.

### Breaking changes and deprecations

- `$apply()` on an Expr or a Series is renamed `$map_elements()`, and `$map()`
  is renamed `$map_batches()`. `$map()` and `$apply()` will be removed in 0.13.0 (#534).
- Removed `$days()`, `$hours()`, `$minutes()`, `$seconds()`, `$milliseconds()`,
  `$microseconds()`, `$nanoseconds()`. Those were deprecated in 0.11.0 (#550).
- `pl$concat_list()`: elements being strings are now interpreted as column names.
  Use `pl$lit` to concat with a string.
- `<RPolarsExpr>$lit_to_s()` is renamed to `<RPolarsExpr>$to_series()` (#582).
- `<RPolarsExpr>$lit_to_df()` is removed (#582).
- Change class names and function names associated with class names.
  - The class name of all objects created by polars (`DataFrame`, `LazyFrame`,
    `Expr`, `Series`, etc.) has changed. They now start with `RPolars`, for example
    `RPolarsDataFrame`. This will only break your code if you directly use those
    class names, such as in S3 methods (#554, #585).
  - Private methods have been unified so that they do not have the `RPolars` prefix (#584).

### What's changed

- The Extract function (`[`) for DataFrame can use columns not included in the
  result for filtering (#547).
- The Extract function (`[`) for LazyFrame can filter rows with Expressions (#547).
- `as_polars_df()` for `data.frame` has a new argument `rownames` for to convert
  the row.names attribute to a column.
  This option is inspired by the `tibble::as_tibble()` function (#561).
- `as_polars_df()` for `data.frame` has a new argument `make_names_unique` (#561).
- New methods `$str$to_date()`, `$str$to_time()`, `$str$to_datetime()` as
  alternatives to `$str$strptime()` (#558).
- The `dim()` function for DataFrame and LazyFrame correctly returns integer instead of
  double (#577).
- The conversion of R's `POSIXct` class to Polars datetime now works correctly with millisecond
  precision (#589).
- `<LazyFrame>$filter()`, `<DataFrame>$filter()`, and `pl$when()` now allow multiple conditions
  to be separated by commas, like `lf$filter(pl$col("foo") == 1, pl$col("bar") != 2)` (#598).
- New method `$replace()` for expressions (#601).
- Better error messages for trailing argument commas such as `pl$DataFrame()$select("a",)` (#607).
- New function `pl$threadpool_size()` to get the number of threads used by Polars (#620).
  Thread pool size is also included in the output of `pl$polars_info()`.

## Polars R Package 0.11.0

### BREAKING CHANGES DUE TO RUST-POLARS UPDATE

- rust-polars is updated to 0.35.0 (2023-11-17) (#515)
  - changes in `$write_csv()` and `sink_csv()`: `has_header` is renamed
    `include_header` and there's a new argument `include_bom`.
  - `pl$cov()` gains a `ddof` argument.
  - `$cumsum()`, `$cumprod()`, `$cummin()`, `$cummax()`, `$cumcount()` are
    renamed `$cum_sum()`, `$cum_prod()`, `$cum_min()`, `$cum_max()`,
    `$cum_count()`.
  - `take()` and `take_every()` are renamed `$gather()` and `gather_every()`.
  - `$shift()` and `$shift_and_fill()` now accept Expr as input.
  - when `reverse = TRUE`, `$arg_sort()` now places null values in the first
    positions.
  - Removed argument `ambiguous` in `$dt$truncate()` and `$dt$round()`.
  - `$str$concat()` gains an argument `ignore_nulls`.

### Breaking changes and deprecations

- The rowwise computation when several columns are passed to `pl$min()`, `pl$max()`,
  and `pl$sum()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.12.0. Passing several
  columns to these functions will now compute the min/max/sum in each column
  separately. Use `pl$min_horizontal()` `pl$max_horizontal()`, and
  `pl$sum_horizontal()` instead for rowwise computation (#508).
- `$is_not()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.12.0. Use `$not()` instead
  (#511, #531).
- `$is_first()` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.12.0. Use `$is_first_distinct()`
  instead (#531).
- In `pl$concat()`, the argument `to_supertypes` is removed. Use the suffix
  `"_relaxed"` in the `how` argument to cast columns to their shared supertypes
  (#523).
- All duration methods (`days()`, `hours()`, `minutes()`, `seconds()`,
  `milliseconds()`, `microseconds()`, `nanoseconds()`) are renamed, for example
  from `$dt$days()` to `$dt$total_days()`. The old usage is deprecated and will
  be removed in 0.12.0 (#530).
- DataFrame methods `$as_data_frame()` is removed in favor of `$to_data_frame()` (#533).
- GroupBy methods `$as_data_frame()` and `$to_data_frame()` which were used to
  convert GroupBy objects to R data frames are removed.
  Use `$ungroup()` method and the `as.data.frame()` function instead (#533).

### What's changed

- Fix the installation issue on Ubuntu 20.04 (#528, thanks @brownag).
- New methods `$write_json()` and `$write_ndjson()` for DataFrame (#502).
- Removed argument `name` in `pl$date_range()`, which was deprecated for a while
  (#503).
- New private method `.pr$DataFrame$drop_all_in_place(df)` to drop `DataFrame`
  in-place, to release memory without invoking gc(). However, if there are other
  strong references to any of the underlying Series or arrow arrays, that memory
  will specifically not be released. This method is aimed for r-polars extensions,
  and will be kept stable as much as possible (#504).
- New functions `pl$min_horizontal()`, `pl$max_horizontal()`, `pl$sum_horizontal()`,
  `pl$all_horizontal()`, `pl$any_horizontal()` (#508).
- New generic functions `as_polars_df()` and `as_polars_lf()` to create polars
  DataFrames and LazyFrames (#519).
- New method `$ungroup()` for `GroupBy` and `LazyGroupBy` (#522).
- New method `$rolling()` to apply an Expr over a rolling window based on
  date/datetime/numeric indices (#470).
- New methods `$name$to_lowercase()` and `$name$to_uppercase()` to transform
  variable names (#529).
- New method `$is_last_distinct()` (#531).
- New methods of the Expressions class, `$floor_div()`, `$mod()`, `$eq_missing()`
  and `$neq_missing()`. The base R operators `%/%` and `%%` for Expressions are
  now translated to `$floor_div()` and `$mod()` (#523).
  - Note that `$mod()` of Polars is different from the R operator `%%`, which is
    not guaranteed `x == (x %% y) + y * (x %/% y)`.
    Please check the upstream issue [pola-rs/polars#10570](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/10570).
- The extract function (`[`) for polars objects now behave more like for base R objects (#543).

  in the data (#486).
- S3 methods for base R functions are well documented (#494).
- A bug that failing `pl$SQLContext()$register()` without load the package was fixed (#496).

  - The following methods now accept an `Expr` as input: `$top_k()`, `$bottom_k()`,
    `$list$join()`, `$str$strip_chars()`, `$str$strip_chars_start()`,
    `$str$strip_chars_end()`, `$str$split_exact()`.
  - The following methods were renamed:
    - `$str$n_chars()` -> `$str$len_chars()`
    - `$str$lengths()` -> `$str$len_bytes()`
    - `$str$ljust()` -> `$str$pad_end()`
    - `$str$rjust()` -> `$str$pad_start()`
  - `$concat()` with `how = "diagonal"` now accepts an argument `to_supertypes`
    to automatically convert concatenated columns to the same type.
  - `pl$enable_string_cache()` doesn't take any argument anymore. The string cache
    can now be disabled with `pl$disable_string_cache()`.
  - `$scan_parquet()` gains an argument `hive_partitioning`.
  - `$meta$tree_format()` has a better formatted output.

  - `sep` is renamed `separator`, `overwrite_dtypes` is renamed `dtypes`,
    `parse_dates` is renamed `try_parse_dates`.
  - new arguments `rechunk`, `eol_char`, `raise_if_empty`, `truncate_ragged_lines`
  - `path` can now be a vector of characters indicating several paths to CSV files.
    This only works if all CSV files have the same schema.

### What's changed

  like objects. To use this feature, needs to build Rust library with full features
  (#457).

  an Expr (#462).
- New methods `$read_ndjson()` and `$scan_ndjson()` (#471).
- New method `$with_context()` for `LazyFrame` to have access to columns from
  other Data/LazyFrames during the computation (#475).

  (#435, #448, #450, #451)

## Polars R Package 0.8.1

### What's changed

- New string method `to_titlecase()` (#371).
- Although stated in news for PR (#334) `strip = true` was not actually set for the

## Polars R Package 0.8.0

### BREAKING CHANGES DUE TO RUST-POLARS UPDATE

rust-polars was updated to 0.32.0, which comes with many breaking changes and new
features. Unrelated breaking changes and new features are put in separate sections
(#334):

- update of rust toolchain: nightly bumped to nightly-2023-07-27 and MSRV is
  now >=1.70.
- param `common_subplan_elimination = TRUE` in `<LazyFrame>` methods `$collect()`,
  `$sink_ipc()` and `$sink_parquet()` is renamed and split into
  `comm_subplan_elim = TRUE` and `comm_subexpr_elim = TRUE`.
- Series_is_sorted: nulls_last argument is dropped.
- `when-then-otherwise` classes are renamed to `When`, `Then`, `ChainedWhen`
  and `ChainedThen`. The syntactically illegal methods have been removed, e.g.
  chaining `$when()` twice.
- Github release + R-universe is compiled with `profile=release-optimized`,
  which now includes `strip=false`, `lto=fat` & `codegen-units=1`. This should
  make the binary a bit smaller and faster. See also FULL_FEATURES=`true` env
  flag to enable simd with nightly rust. For development or faster compilation,
  use instead `profile=release`.
- `fmt` arg is renamed `format` in `pl$Ptimes` and `<Expr>$str$strptime`.
- `<Expr>$approx_unique()` changed name to `<Expr>$approx_n_unique()`.
- `<Expr>$str$json_extract` arg `pat` changed to `dtype` and has a new argument
  `infer_schema_length = 100`.
- Some arguments in `pl$date_range()` have changed: `low` -> `start`,
  `high` -> `end`, `lazy = TRUE` -> `eager = FALSE`. Args `time_zone` and `time_unit`
  can no longer be used to implicitly cast time types. These two args can only
  be used to annotate a naive time unit. Mixing `time_zone` and `time_unit` for
  `start` and `end` is not allowed anymore.
- `<Expr>$is_in()` operation no longer supported for dtype `null`.
- Various subtle changes:
  - `(pl$lit(NA_real_) == pl$lit(NA_real_))$lit_to_s()` renders now to `null`
    not `true`.
  - `pl$lit(NA_real_)$is_in(pl$lit(NULL))$lit_to_s()` renders now to `false`
    and before `true`
  - `pl$lit(numeric(0))$sum()$lit_to_s()` now yields `0f64` and not `null`.
- `<Expr>$all()` and `<Expr>$any()` have a new arg `drop_nulls = TRUE`.
- `<Expr>$sample()` and `<Expr>$shuffle()` have a new arg `fix_seed`.
- `<DataFrame>$sort()` and `<LazyFrame>$sort()` have a new arg
  `maintain_order = FALSE`.

### OTHER BREAKING CHANGES

- `$rpow()` is removed. It should never have been translated. Use `^` and `$pow()`
  instead (#346).
- `<LazyFrame>$collect_background()` renamed `<LazyFrame>$collect_in_background()`
  and reworked. Likewise `PolarsBackgroundHandle` reworked and renamed to
  `RThreadHandle` (#311).
- `pl$scan_arrow_ipc` is now called `pl$scan_ipc` (#343).

### Other changes

- Stream query to file with `pl$sink_ipc()` and `pl$sink_parquet()` (#343)
- New method `$explode()` for `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` (#314).
- New method `$clone()` for `LazyFrame` (#347).
- New method `$fetch()` for `LazyFrame` (#319).
- New methods `$optimization_toggle()` and `$profile()` for `LazyFrame` (#323).
- `$with_column()` is now deprecated (following upstream `polars`). It will be
  removed in 0.9.0. It should be replaced with `$with_columns()` (#313).
- New lazy function translated: `concat_str()` to concatenate several columns
  into one (#349).
- New stat functions `pl$cov()`, `pl$rolling_cov()` `pl$corr()`, `pl$rolling_corr()` (#351).
- Add functions `pl$set_global_rpool_cap()`, `pl$get_global_rpool_cap()`, class `RThreadHandle` and
  `in_background = FALSE` param to `<Expr>$map()` and `$apply()`. It is now possible to run R code
  with `<LazyFrame>collect_in_background()` and/or let polars parallize R code in an R processes
  pool. See `RThreadHandle-class` in reference docs for more info. (#311)
- Internal IPC/shared-mem channel to serialize and send R objects / polars DataFrame across
  R processes. (#311)
- Compile environment flag RPOLARS_ALL_FEATURES changes name to RPOLARS_FULL_FEATURES. If 'true'
  will trigger something like `Cargo build --features "full_features"` which is not exactly the same
  as `Cargo build --all-features`. Some dev features are not included in "full_features" (#311).
- Fix bug to allow using polars without library(polars) (#355).
- New methods `<LazyFrame>$optimization_toggle()` + `$profile()` and enable rust-polars feature
  CSE: "Activate common subplan elimination optimization" (#323)
- Named expression e.g. `pl$select(newname = pl$lit(2))` are no longer experimental
  and allowed as default (#357).
- Added methods `pl$enable_string_cache()`, `pl$with_string_cache()` and `pl$using_string_cache()`
  for joining/comparing Categorical series/columns (#361).
- Added an S3 generic `as_polars_series()` where users or developers of extensions
  can define a custom way to convert their format to Polars format. This generic
  must return a Polars series. See #368 for an example (#369).
- Private API Support for Arrow Stream import/export of DataFrame between two R packages that uses
  rust-polars. [See R package example here](https://github.com/rpolars/extendrpolarsexamples)
  (#326).

## Polars R Package 0.7.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Replace the argument `reverse` by `descending` in all sorting functions. This
  is for consistency with the upstream Polars (#291, #293).
- Bump rust-polars from 2023-04-20 unreleased version to version 0.30.0 released in 2023-05-30 (#289).
  - Rename `concat_lst` to `concat_list`.

  - Remove `tz_aware` and `utc` arguments from `str_parse`.
  - in `$date_range`'s the `lazy` argument is now `TRUE` by default.
- The functions to read CSV have been renamed `scan_csv` and `read_csv` for
  consistency with the upstream Polars. `scan_xxx` and `read_xxx` functions are now accessed via `pl`,
  e.g. `pl$scan_csv()` (#305).

### What's changed

- New method `$rename()` for `LazyFrame` and `DataFrame` (#239)
- `<DataFrame>$unique()` and `<LazyFrame>$unique()` gain a `maintain_order` argument (#238).
- New `pl$LazyFrame()` to quickly create a `LazyFrame`, mostly in examples or
  for demonstration purposes (#240).
- Polars is internally moving away from string errors to a new error-type called `RPolarsErr` both on rust- and R-side. Final error messages should look very similar (#233).
- `$columns()`, `$schema()`, `$dtypes()` for `LazyFrame` implemented (#250).
- Improvements to internal `RPolarsErr`. Also `RPolarsErr` will now print each context of the error on a separate line (#250).
- Fix memory leak on error bug. Fix printing of `%` bug. Prepare for renaming of polars classes (#252).
- Add helpful reference landing page at `polars.github.io/reference_home` (#223, #264).
- Supports Rust 1.65 (#262, #280)
  - rust-polars' `simd` feature is now disabled by default. To enable it, set the environment variable
    `RPOLARS_ALL_FEATURES` to `true` when build r-polars (#262).
  - `opt-level` of `argminmax` is now set to `1` in the `release` profile to support Rust < 1.66.
    The profile can be changed by setting the environment variable `RPOLARS_PROFILE` (when set to `release-optimized`,
    `opt-level` of `argminmax` is set to `3`).
- A new function `pl$polars_info()` will tell which features enabled (#271, #285, #305).
- `select()` now accepts lists of expressions. For example, `<DataFrame>$select(l_expr)`
  works with `l_expr = list(pl$col("a"))` (#265).
- LazyFrame gets some new S3 methods: `[`, `dim()`, `dimnames()`, `length()`, `names()` (#301)
- `<DataFrame>$glimpse()` is a fast `str()`-like view of a `DataFrame` (#277).
- `$over()` now accepts a vector of column names (#287).
- New method `<DataFrame>$describe()` (#268).
- Cross joining is now possible with `how = "cross"` in `$join()` (#310).
- Add license info of all rust crates to `LICENSE.note` (#309).
- With CRAN 0.7.0 release candidate (#308).
  - New author accredited, SHIMA Tatsuya (@eitsupi).
  - DESCRIPTION revised.
